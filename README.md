# AndrewConnell.com Site Issues

My blog, [andrewconnell.com](https://www.andrewconnell.com) was relaunched in August 2019. I started blogging in 2003 and since then have relaunched the site with multiple blog engines (.Text, Subtext, Orchard and now Hugo).

When I moved to Hugo, I fixed a lot of known issues, but after 16 years of blogging, I know there's a lot of old stuff that doesn't work. Post launch, things are still getting fixed, but you may come across something. If so, mind sharing it?

I setup this repo for people to submit issues they find on my site. Think you found one of these things?

- broken link
- broken image
- malformed code / content
- rendering issue

If so, open an [issue](/andrewconnell/accom-site-issues/issues/new) to let me know!
